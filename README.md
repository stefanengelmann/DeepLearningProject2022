**Branch was rename to main**: Run `git pull && git checkout main` to switch to the new branch.

**Demucs was just updated!**: much better SDR, smaller models, more data augmentation and PyPI support.

**For the initial version of Demucs:** [Go this commit][original_demucs].
If you are experiencing issues and want the old Demucs back, please fill an issue, and then you can get back to the v1 with
`git checkout v1`.

We provide an implementation of Demucs and Conv-Tasnet for music source separation on the [MusDB][musdb] dataset.
They can separate drums, bass and vocals from the rest with state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous waveform or spectrogram based methods.
The architecture and results obtained are detailed in our paper
[Music Source Separation in the waveform domain][demucs_arxiv].

Demucs is based on U-Net convolutional architecture inspired by [Wave-U-Net][waveunet] and
[SING][sing], with GLUs, a BiLSTM between the encoder and decoder, specific initialization of weights
and transposed convolutions in the decoder.

[Conv-Tasnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07454)
is a separation model developed for speech which predicts a mask on a learnt over-complete linear representation
using a purely convolutional model with stride of 1 and dilated convolutional blocks.
We reused the code from the [kaituoxu/Conv-TasNet][tasnet]
repository and added support for multiple audio channels.


Demucs achieves a state-of-the-art SDR performance of 6.3 when trained only on MusDB.
Conv-Tasnet achieves an SDR of 5.7, to be compared with the best performing spectrogram domain model [D3Net][d3net]
with an average SDR of 6.
Unlike Conv-Tasnet, Demucs reacts positively to pitch/tempo shift augmentation (+0.5 SDR). However, Demucs
still suffers from leakage from other sources, in particular between the vocals and other sources, which is less of a problem
for Conv-Tasnet. When trained with 150 extra tracks, Demucs reaches an SDR of 6.8, and even surpasses the IRM oracle
for the bass source (7.6 against 7.1 for the oracle).
See [our paper][demucs_arxiv] Section 6 for more details or listen to our
[audio samples][audio] .

## Important news if you are already using Demucs

See the [release notes](./docs/release.md) for more details.

- 11/05/2021: Adding support for MusDB-HQ and arbitrary wav set, for the MDX challenge. For more information
on joining the challenge with Demucs see [the Demucs MDX instructions](docs/mdx.md)
- 28/04/2021: **Demucs v2**, with extra augmentation and DiffQ based quantization.
  **EVERYTHING WILL BREAK**, please restart from scratch following the instructions hereafter.
  This version also adds overlap between prediction frames, with linear transition from one to the next,
  which should prevent sudden changes at frame boundaries. Also, Demucs is now on PyPI, so for separation
  only, installation is as easy as `pip install demucs` :)
- 13/04/2020: **Demucs released under MIT**: We are happy to release Demucs under the MIT licence.
    We hope that this will broaden the impact of this research to new applications.


## Comparison with other models

An audio comparison of Demucs and Conv-Tasnet with other state-of-the-art methods such as [Wave-U-Net][waveunet], [OpenUnmix][openunmix] or
[MMDenseLSTM][mmdenselstm] is available on [the audio comparison page][audio].
We provide hereafter a summary of the different metrics presented in the paper.
You can also compare [Spleeter][spleeter], Open-Unmix, Demucs and Conv-Tasnet on one of my favorite
songs on our [soundcloud playlist][soundcloud].

### Comparison of accuracy

`Overall SDR` is the mean of the SDR for each of the 4 sources, `MOS Quality` is a rating from 1 to 5
of the naturalness and absence of artifacts given by human listeners (5 = no artifacts), `MOS Contamination`
is a rating from 1 to 5 with 5 being zero contamination by other sources. We refer the reader to our [paper][demucs_arxiv], Section 5 and 6,
for more details.

| Model         | Domain     | Extra data?  | Overall SDR | MOS Quality | MOS Contamination |
| ------------- |-------------| -----:|------:|----:|----:|
| [Open-Unmix][openunmix]      | spectrogram | no | 5.3 | 3.0 | 3.3 |

## Requirements

You will need at least Python 3.7. See `requirements.txt` for requirements for separation only,
and `environment-[cpu|cuda].yml` if you want to train a new model.

## Web Demo

Integrated to [Huggingface Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) with [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio). See demo: [![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/demucs)

### For Windows users

Everytime you see `python3`, replace it with `python.exe`. You should always run commands from the
Anaconda console.

### For musicians

If you just want to use Demucs to separate tracks, you can install it with

    python3 -m pip -U install demucs

Advanced OS support are provided on the following page, **you must read the page for your OS before posting an issues**:
- **If you are using Windows:** [Windows support](docs/windows.md).
- **If you are using MAC OS X:** [Mac OS X support](docs/mac.md).
- **If you are using Linux:** [Linux support](docs/linux.md).

### For machine learning scientists

If you have anaconda installed, you can run from the root of this repository:

    conda env update -f environment-cpu.yml # if you don't have GPUs
    conda env update -f environment-cuda.yml # if you have GPUs
    conda activate demucs
    pip install -e .

This will create a `demucs` environment with all the dependencies installed.


You will also need to install [soundstretch/soundtouch](https://www.surina.net/soundtouch/soundstretch.html): on Mac OSX you can do `brew install sound-touch`,
and on Ubuntu `sudo apt-get install soundstretch`. This is used for the
pitch/tempo augmentation.

### Running in Docker

Thanks to @xserrat, there is now a Docker image definition ready for using Demucs. This can ensure all libraries are correctly installed without interfering with the host OS. See his repo [Docker Facebook Demucs](https://github.com/xserrat/docker-facebook-demucs) for more information.


### Running from Colab

I made a Colab to easily separate track with Demucs. Note that
transfer speeds with Colab are a bit slow for large media files,
but it will allow you to use Demucs without installing anything.

## Separating tracks

In order to try Demucs or Conv-Tasnet on your tracks, simply run from the root of this repository

```bash
python3 -m demucs.separate PATH_TO_AUDIO_FILE_1 [PATH_TO_AUDIO_FILE_2 ...] # for Demucs
python3 -m demucs.separate --mp3 PATH_TO_AUDIO_FILE_1 --mp3-bitrate BITRATE # output files saved as MP3
python3 -m demucs.separate -n tasnet PATH_TO_AUDIO_FILE_1 ... # for Conv-Tasnet
```

If you have a GPU, but you run out of memory, please add `-d cpu` to the command line. See the section hereafter for more details on the memory requirements for GPU acceleration.

Separated tracks are stored in the `separated/MODEL_NAME/TRACK_NAME` folder. There you will find four stereo wav files sampled at 44.1 kHz: `drums.wav`, `bass.wav`,
`other.wav`, `vocals.wav` (or `.mp3` if you used the `--mp3` option).

All audio formats supported by `torchaudio` can be processed (i.e. wav, mp3, flac, ogg/vorbis etc.).
Audio is resampled on the fly if necessary.
The output will be a wave file, either in int16 format or float32 (if `--float32` is passed).
You can pass `--mp3` to save as mp3 instead, and set the bitrate with `--mp3-bitrate` (default is 320kbps).

Other pre-trained models can be selected with the `-n` flag.
The list of pre-trained models is:
- `demucs`: Demucs trained on MusDB,
- `demucs_quantized`: Quantized Demucs with [diffq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/diffq),
    this is much smaller (150MB instead of 1GB) and quality should be exactly the same. Let me know if you disagree.
    As a result, this is the one used by default.
- `demucs_extra`: Demucs trained with extra training data,
- `demucs48_hq`: Demucs with 48 initial hidden channels, trained on [MusDB-HQ](https://zenodo.org/record/3338373),
 used as a baseline for the [Music Demixing Challenge 2021](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/music-demixing-challenge-ismir-2021),
- `tasnet`: Conv-Tasnet trained on MusDB,
- `tasnet_extra`: Conv-Tasnet trained with extra training data.


The `--shifts=SHIFTS` performs multiple predictions with random shifts (a.k.a the *shift trick*) of the input and average them. This makes prediction `SHIFTS` times
slower but improves the accuracy of Demucs by 0.2 points of SDR.
It has limited impact on Conv-Tasnet as the model is by nature almost time equivariant.
The value of 10 was used on the original paper, although 5 yields mostly the same gain.
It is deactivated by default but it does make vocals a bit smoother.

The `--overlap` option controls the amount of overlap between prediction windows (for Demucs one window is 10 seconds).
Default is 0.25 (i.e. 25%) which is probably fine.


### Memory requirements for GPU acceleration

If you want to use GPU acceleration, you will need at least 8GB of RAM on your GPU for `demucs` and 4GB for `tasnet`. Sorry, the code for demucs is not super optimized for memory! If you do not have enough memory on your GPU, simply add `-d cpu` to the command line to use the CPU. With Demucs, processing time should be roughly equal to the duration of the track.


## Examining the results from the paper experiments

The metrics for our experiments are stored in the `results` folder. In particular
`museval` json evaluations are stored in `results/evals/EXPERIMENT NAME/results`.
You can aggregate and display the results using
```bash
python3 valid_table.py -p # show valid loss, aggregated with multiple random seeds
python3 result_table.py -p # show SDR on test set, aggregated with multiple random seeds
python3 result_table.py -p SIR # also SAR, ISR, show other metrics
```
The `std` column shows the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of runs.

## Training Demucs and evaluating on the MusDB dataset

If you want to train Demucs from scratch, you will need a copy of the MusDB dataset.
It can be obtained on the [MusDB website][musdb].
To start training on a single GPU or CPU, use:
```bash
python3 -m demucs -b 4  --musdb MUSDB_PATH # Demucs
python3 -m demucs -b 4  --musdb MUSDB_PATH --tasnet --samples=80000 --split_valid # Conv-Tasnet
```
The `-b 4` flag will set the batch size to 4. The default is 4 and will crash on a single GPU.
Demucs was trained on 8 V100 with 32GB of RAM.
The default parameters (batch size, number of channels etc)
might not be suitable for 16GB GPUs.
To train on all available GPUs, use:
```bash
python3 run.py --musdb MUSDB_PATH [EXTRA_FLAGS]
```

This will launch one process per GPU and report the output of the first one. When interrupting
such a run, it is possible some of the children processes are not killed properly, be mindful of that.
If you want to use only some of the available GPUs, export the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` variable to
select those.

To see all the possible options, use `python3 -m demucs --help`.


### MusDB HQ

To train on MusDB HQ, use the following flags:

```bash
python3 -m demucs -b 4 --musdb MUSDB_HQ_PATH --is_wav [...]
```

### Custom wav dataset

You can trained on a custom wav dataset using the following command.
At the moment, you still need to pass the MusDB path for evaluation, and the model
must use the standard sources (bass, drums, other, vocals). However, it should be relatively
easy to fork the code to support different patterns.

```bash
python3 -m demucs -b 4 --wav PATH_TO_WAV_DATASET [...]
```

The folder `PATH_TO_WAV_DATASET` should contain two sub-directories : `train` and `valid`. Each of those
should contain one folder per track. Each track folder must contain one file for each source (`drums.wav`, `bass.wav`, `other.wav`, `vocals.wav`) and one file for the mixture (`mixture.wav`).

By default, the custom wav dataset will replace MusDB. To concatenate it with MusDB, pass `--concat` (if you are using musdbhq, dont forget to pass `--is_wav`).

### Fine tuning

You can fine tune from one of the pre-trained models listed in the [Separating tracks Section](#separating-tracks)
by passing the `--init=PRETRAINED_NAME`, i.e. for Demucs or ConvTasnet:

```bash
python3 -m demucs -b 4  --musdb MUSDB_PATH --init demucs # Demucs
python3 -m demucs -b 4  --musdb MUSDB_PATH --tasnet --samples=80000 --split_valid --init tasnet # Conv-Tasnet
```

### About checkpointing

Demucs will automatically generate an experiment name from the command line flags you provided.
It will checkpoint after every epoch. If a checkpoint already exist for the combination of flags
you provided, it will be automatically used. In order to ignore/delete a previous checkpoint,
run with the `-R` flag.
The optimizer state, the latest model and the best model on valid are stored. At the end of each
epoch, the checkpoint will erase the one from the previous epoch.
By default, checkpoints are stored in the `./checkpoints` folder. This can be changed using the
`--checkpoints CHECKPOINT_FOLDER` flag.

Not all options will impact the name of the experiment. For instance `--workers` is not
shown in the name, therefore, changing this parameter will not impact the checkpoint file
used. Refer to [parser.py](demucs/parser.py) for more details.


### Test set evaluations

Test set evaluations computed with [museval][museval] will be stored under
`evals/EXPERIMENT NAME/results`. The experiment name
is the first thing printed when running `python3 run.py`  or `python3 -m demucs`. If you used
the flag `--save`, there will also be a folder `evals/EXPERIMENT NAME/wavs` containing
all the extracted waveforms.


#### Running on a cluster

If you have a cluster available with Slurm, you can set the `run_slurm.py` as the target of a
slurm job, using as many nodes as you want and a single task per node. `run_slurm.py` will
create one process per GPU and run in a distributed manner. Multinode training is supported.

### Extracting Raw audio for faster loading

We observed that loading from compressed mp4 audio lead to unreliable speed, sometimes reducing by
a factor of 2 the number of iterations per second. It is possible to extract all data
to raw PCM f32e format. If you wish to store the raw data under `RAW_PATH`, run the following
command first:

```bash
python3 -m demucs.raw [--workers=10] MUSDB_PATH RAW_PATH
```

You can then train using the `--raw RAW_PATH` flag, for instance:
```bash
python3 run.py --raw RAW_PATH --musdb MUSDB_PATH
```
You still need to provide the path to the MusDB dataset as we always load the test set
from the original MusDB.


### Results reproduction
To reproduce the performance of the main Demucs model in our paper:
```bash
# Extract raw waveforms. This is optional
python3 -m demucs.data MUSDB_PATH RAW_PATH
export DEMUCS_RAW=RAW_PATH
# Train models with default parameters and multiple seeds
python3 run.py --seed 42 # for Demucs
python3 run.py --seed 42 --tasnet --X=10 --samples=80000 --epochs=180 --split_valid # for Conv-Tasnet
# Repeat for --seed = 43, 44, 45 and 46
```

You can visualize the results aggregated on multiple seeds using
```bash
python3 valid_table.py # compare validation losses
python3 result_table.py # compare test SDR
python3 result_table.py SIR # compare test SIR, also available ISR, and SAR
```

You can look at our exploration file [dora.py](dora.py) to see the exact flags
for all experiments (grid search and ablation study). If you have a Slurm cluster,
you can also try adapting it to run on your own.


### Environment variables

If you do not want to always specify the path to MUSDB, you can export the following variables:
```bash
export DEMUCS_MUSDB=PATH TO MUSDB
# Optionally, if you extracted raw pcm data
# export DEMUCS_RAW=PATH TO RAW PCM
```
