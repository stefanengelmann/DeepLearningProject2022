# Speech Source Separation in the Waveform Domain

**Redesigned Demucs for Speec Source Separation!**: DTU project focused on changing Demucs v2 to be used on Speech Source Separation and comparing the result with Conv-Tasnet. 

**Recreating results**: The actual model is not present here on github as it is too big, if you want access to the actual model contact s184073@student.dtu.dk. 

The notebook main.ipynb is used to recreate all the results.
